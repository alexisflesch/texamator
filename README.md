---------------------------- Instructions --------------------------------------------

You need the following to run this programm :
- latex
- dvipng
- python-qt4

If you want to use okular inside the application (recommended) to preview your 
dvi/ps/pdf, you also need to install :
- python-kde4

To launch the programm you can double-click on the file "TeXamator.py" or open a shell,
hop to the directory and type in "python TeXamator.py". This last method is preferred
because it will let you see LaTeX running in the background.

- Change .partielator dir to .texamator and re-organize it
- Rewrite how settings are saved :
    | simplify compile sequence which is outdated
    | remove checks on .partielator dir
- add a "QCut" feature?
- add an "Undo" feature?
- When shuffling the entire list : keep selection (cosmetic change)     
- Update documentation on compile sequence
- Rethink the preambles/postamble :
    | maybe keep only one tab in the preferences and add something in the menu to select the preamble/postamble to compile inside TeXamator.
    | add two settings : preferred preamble inside TeXamator, preferred preamble for exportation
- Create a help.pdf file to show on startup
- Rework on resizing and updating the pdf
